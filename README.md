# Password-Generator

The purpose of this project was to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

This application features HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

This project helped me understand the use of JavaScript and how it's methods
can improve how a web application functions.
